# Udacity-Feed-Reader-Testing

A Udacity Frontend nanodegree  project.

This project tested my ability to use a testing suite, like Jasmine, to validate my code. We started with a Feed Reader App and were required to write test spec in Jasmine.
This application uses [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for testing.

# How to run
Download the repo and open index.html with your favorite ES6 compatible browser.
The tests were written in the feedreader.js file. The test results appears at the bottom of the `index.html` page
